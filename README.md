## Generate a basic package

The default package generator in atom generates a complex package that contains too much boilerplate.

This package generates a much [simpler package](https://github.com/mihirgogate/basic-package) which is easier to understand and run tests in.

Simple run the command


`basic-package-generator:generate-basic-package`

to create a new package which has the minimal bootstrapping code you need to get started.
